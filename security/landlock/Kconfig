	  This selects Landlock, a programmatic access control.  It enables to
	  restrict processes on the fly (i.e. create a sandbox) or log some
	  actions.  The security policy is a set of eBPF programs, dedicated to
	  allow or deny a list of actions on specific kernel objects (e.g.
	  process).

	  You need to enable seccomp filter to apply a security policy to a
	  process hierarchy (e.g. application with built-in sandboxing).

	  See Documentation/security/landlock/ for further information.

	  If you are unsure how to answer this question, answer N.
