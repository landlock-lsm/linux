	  Landlock is a safe sandboxing mechanism which enables processes to
	  restrict themselves (and their future children) by gradually
	  enforcing tailored access control policies.  A security policy is a
	  set of access rights (e.g. open a file in read-only, make a
	  directory) tied to a file hierarchy.  The configuration can be set by
	  any processes, including unprivileged ones, thanks to the landlock()
	  system call.

	  See Documentation/security/landlock/ for further information.
