	  Landlock is a safe sandboxing mechanism which enables processes to
	  restrict themselves (and their future children) by gradually
	  enforcing tailored access control policies.  A security policy is a
	  set of access rights (e.g. open a file in read-only, make a
	  directory, etc.) tied to a file hierarchy.  Such policy can be configured
	  and enforced by any processes for themselves thanks to dedicated system
	  calls: landlock_create_ruleset(), landlock_add_rule(), and
	  landlock_enforce_ruleset_current().

	  See Documentation/userspace-api/landlock.rst for further information.
