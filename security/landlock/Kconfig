	  Landlock is a stacked LSM which allows any user to load a security policy
	  to restrict their processes (i.e. create a sandbox). The policy is a list
	  of stacked eBPF programs for some LSM hooks. Each program can do some
	  access comparison to check if an access request is legitimate.

	  Further information about eBPF can be found in
	  Documentation/networking/filter.txt

	  If you are unsure how to answer this question, answer Y.
