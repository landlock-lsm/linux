 * the layer level of a new rule is the incremented top layer level (cf.
 * &struct landlock_ruleset).  If there is no rule (from this domain) tied to
 * the same object, then the depth of the new rule is 1. However, if there is
 * already a rule tied to the same object and if this rule's layer level is the
 * previous top layer level, then the depth and the layer level are both
 * incremented and the rule is updated with the new access rights (boolean
 * AND).
